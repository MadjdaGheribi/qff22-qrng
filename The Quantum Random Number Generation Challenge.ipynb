        "After the workshop, we did today we conclude that there exists more advanced algorithm's to generate random numbers but generating truly random numbers using a classical computer or a classical system is impossible. But the use of quantum computers, in this case, is very helpful because while the numbers generated from a quantum computer are amongst the most random, the practicality of connecting to one of IBM's quantum computers to generate a large amount of these numbers is nonexistent. For most real-world use cases that require such high-caliber random numbers, an off-the-shelf hardware RNG would suffice."
